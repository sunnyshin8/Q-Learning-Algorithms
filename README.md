# Optimal Path Finding in a GridWorld
----
Many real life applications such as **Intelligent Transportation System, Robot Navigation and Internet Routing** can function efficiently when an optimal path between any two points is provided. Path finding algorithms are used to find optimal paths between two nodes in a graph like environment. In this project, various algorithms from different domains are evaluated and compared to find optimal path for traversal in a simulated grid world environment with obstacles.

Optimal path finding can be implemented using various State-of-the-art algorithms like ***Breadth-First-Search (BFS), Depth-First-Search (DFS), A-Star (A*), Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm etc.** In this paper we have implemented different classes of algorithm with different constraints. The first algorithm is A-Star which is an informed search algorithm. The second is ***Genetic algorithm (GA),*** which is based on meta-heuristics and improves the results based on the previous iterations. The third implementation is ***Q-learning and State Action Reward State Action (SARSA)*** algorithms which are part of Reinforcement Learning. These algorithms are based on an agent learning the environment by getting feedback on its actions.

The environment is a grid world which is de_ned by a sizeM, a start position, a destination and random obstacles. The grid dimensions can be unequal (MxN) but to get an idea of the grid size we have used square grids, where a grid of size M will have dimensions ***MxM*** with the start position on the top left and the destination on the bottom right. The obstacles can be either pre-de_ned or randomly placed such that there isn't an obvious direct path between the start and end positions. For the experiments we have used random obstacles with 20.5% obstacle density. Having low or high density gives straight forward answers, since there are usually straight paths with less obstacles and limited number of paths with more obstacles.
